# Create an Azure Container Registry Repository

## üéØ Purpose
In this lab, you'll create a repository in Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store the Docker image for the thomasthorntoncloud app.

## üõ†Ô∏è Create the ACR Terraform Configuration

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Terraform installed
- [ ] Basic understanding of Terraform and ACR concepts

## Steps

1. **Review and Change Terraform .tfvars**
   - Open the [terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/thomast1906/DevOps-The-Hard-Way-Azure/tree/main/Terraform-AZURE-Services-Creation/1-acr/terraform.tfvars) file.
   - Ensure all values are accurate for your environment and unique.

2. **Understand the Terraform Configuration**
   Review the [ACR Terraform configuration](https://github.com/thomast1906/DevOps-The-Hard-Way-Azure/tree/main/Terraform-AZURE-Services-Creation/1-acr). The `acr.tf` file will:
   - [ ] Use a Terraform backend to store the `.tfstate` in an Azure Storage Account
   - [ ] Use the `uksouth` region (can change if desired)
   - [ ] Create a new Resource Group using `azurerm_resource_group`
   - [ ] Create a new ACR using `azurerm_container_registry`

3. **Create the ACR**
   Run the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply

## üîç Verification
To ensure the ACR was created successfully:
1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to ACR in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry%2Fregistries)
3. Look for your newly created ACR
4. Verify its properties match your Terraform configuration

Example screenshot of the Terraform apply command:

## üß† Knowledge Check
After creating the ACR, consider these questions:

1. Why is it beneficial to use Terraform for creating cloud resources like ACR?
2. How does storing the Terraform state in Azure Storage Account help in team environments?
3. What are the advantages of using ACR over other container registry options?

## üí° Pro Tip
Consider setting up replication for your ACR to improve pull performance in different regions. You can add this to your Terraform configuration for automated setup.
